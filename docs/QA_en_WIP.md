## Project description

The project is a web application which allows the user to input a valid DTD file and generate XML corresponding to that DTD, opening it in a web code editor for the user to continue editing.

Some specifically formatted DTDs have the option to be used as a template for a Wikipedia page. If the user has such a DTD, they can specify a Wiki page and what info they want to pull from that page. When generating the XML in this case it will also be filled with the information from the Wiki page.

## Introduction to the QA part of the project

The project is written in **python**. The testing is done using the python module **unittest**. In total there are **47 unit-tests**, which test all of the 9 modules in the project. The overall code coverage is **90%**, as 9/7 of the modules have 100% coverage. The remaining 2 files have untested methods, but they are not used anywhere in the project and exist only to complete the API the components, these methods belong to, provide. The testing done is **white-box testing**, because the project is very complex and there are a lot of staged of computation, which remain unknown to the end users. However all of these stages of the project have to work correctly so the user can use the final finished product effectively. Having so many hidden methods and overall computations in many hidden layers it would be incredibly hard to find bugs had we used black-box testing, because there are tens of methods being called between what the user sees as a GUI and the data being read and parsed. Hence we check the correctness of the program on each possible layer.

## How were the tests written

The tests were written so they cover every possible path in the code execution, if we model the code as a graph from functions, methods, classes and if-else blocks. The tests start from the simplest and most basic methods like reading a file and checking its content and gradually build up to more complex methods, which rely on the simpler ones, such as generating a whole XML tree from parsed DTD objects. Most of these methods are protected/private and they are not usually accessible from outside the class/package they are in, however python allows us to break the encapsulation and have full access to protected/private methods and data fields. If we look at the program as a list of functionalities A -> B -> C -> ... (e.g read file -> check file content for errors -> parse content as DTD -> ...), first the functionality A is being tested, then B is tested (which relies on the correctness of A) and so on. Each possible middle point of the program execution is tested in order. To achieve this we have used the call-stack of the functionalities, to determine which function calls which. Here's an example of one such call-stack. On it we can see the functions at the bottom do not depend on anything else, so they are the first to be tested for correctness. Once we are certain they are covered and work properly we can start with the next set of functions (on the upper level in the graph), which depend on these basic functions, which we have already tested. This way going up the graph we check that each level works correctly before moving up to the next (more complex) one. This can be seen as doing a Width first traversal of the graph starting from the leaves and moving to the root.

## Achieving full data coverage

To make sure that we have tested every possible functionality and all possible input for the application we split the input into equivalence classes, which cover all the possible inputs the program can get. Because our program works with files/strings, which must represent valid DTD documents, in general we have the following equivalence classes:

- file, which doesn't exist
- empty file
- file with invalid data
- file with partially valid data
- file with completely valid data

These classes also apply when the input is a string, because the first thing our program does is read the file to a string. Furthermore, to test certain a functionality we need to split these equivalence classes into sub-classes.  For example the above equivalence classes are important when reading a file/string. However after we have the string and we make sure it is from the class with completely valid data, we have to continue more specific testing, in particular - splitting the data into valid tags (DTD element/attribute tags). This means that the class 'completely valid data' can be split even more into:

- 1 DTD element
- 1 DTD attribute
- 1 element and 1 attribute
- multiple elements and 1 attribute
- 1 element and multiple attributes
- multiple elements and multiple attributes

and so on.

This way on each level of the call-stack we split the tests into different classes to make sure every possible input to that level is tested.

## Achieving full code coverage

To make sure the program has full code coverage, we have used **coverage.py**, to generate information about the lines which are covered by the tests and which aren't.

## Conclusion

All functionalities necessary for the project to function properly have been extensively tested. Some functionalities, which are not used by the project are left untested, however these functionalities are only there to complete the API of certain classes/interfaces of the program. This way we achieve 100% code coverage for the application and 90% code coverage for the code as a whole.

Всички функционалности необходими на проекта да работи и всички функционалности, които проектът използва са тествани. Някой функционалности, които не се използват са оставени нетествани, но те съществуват, за да имат пълнота интерфейсите на софтуера. По този начин постигаме 100% покритие на проекта с тестове и 90% покритие на кода.
